## Getting Started

After installing, in order too activate all features, navigate to the **Shader Graph Extras** tab in the top bar and click **"Upgrade Files"**.

---

## Features

### 🎨 Enhanced Texture Support
- Define **Texture Sampler**, **Texture 2D**, and **Texture Cubemap** inputs and outputs for nodes and subgraphs.

### ✨ New Nodes, Subgraphs and HLSL functions.
- Access to **43 additional combined nodes and subgraphs** along with **HLSL functions which can be used without Shader Graph**.
    - Nodes are located in `Editor\nodes\`.
    - Subgraphs are located in `Assets\shaders\subgraphs\`.
    - HLSL functions are located in `Assets\shaders\hlsl\`.

### 🎭 Dynamic Blend Mode
- Settings this blending mode will allow you to select **Alpha Test** or **Translucent** directly in the Material Editor (default being **Opaque**), instead of being stuck with only hardcoded **Opaque**, **Alpha Test** and **Translucent** options generated by base Shader Graph.

### 💡 Custom Shading Models
- Inject **custom shading models** directly into Shader Graph:
    - Examples of Shading Domains located in `Editor\shadingmodels\`.
